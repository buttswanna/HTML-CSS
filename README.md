This repository contains a data pipeline constructed to clean and extract donation data from the Federal Electoral Commission. 

The goal is to identify repeat donors, so the identifyRepeatDonors.py script parses through each line of the FEC database, checking if each line is valid, and if so, it checks whether the donor has previously contributed to a political campaign
